## The project in which I created a notebook with the ability to create subblocks in which there are fields "title" and "body" in which you can enter text, and a field that displays the date of the last change, all data is saved in localstorage, you can also create additional "body" input field inside the subblocks. JS were used for development. (Compiling with Gulp)
